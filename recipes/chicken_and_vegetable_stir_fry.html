            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat wok over high heat for about 1 minute. Add 1
                    tablespoon of the oil and swirl it around the wok to
                    coat the entire cooking surface and heat for 30-60
                    seconds or until very hot. Add half the chicken strips
                    and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes or until the chicken is
                    sealed and just cooked through. Transfer the chicken
                    to a plate and set aside. Add about half the remaining
                    peanut oil to the wok and repeat the process with the
                    remaining chicken strips.
                </li>
                <li>Add the remaining oil to the wok and heat over high heat
                    until hot. Add the onion and capsicum and stir-fry for 2
                    minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Add the mushrooms and broccolini and stir-fry for a
                    further 2 minutes. Add the ginger, garlic and chillies. 
                    Season with salt and stir-fry for 1 minute or until
                    aromatic.
                </li>
                <li>Add the soy sauce, oyster sauce and water and toss for
                    about 1 minute. Return the chicken to the wok and stir
                    until the vegetables and chicken are coated with the sauces
                    and the vegetables are tender crisp.
                </li>
                <li>Remove the wok from the heat, toss through the bean sprouts
                    and coriander and serve the stir-fry immediately with
                    cooked rice or noodles.
